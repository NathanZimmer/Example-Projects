In this project, I attempted to create a GUI that would go to the catalog website for EMU, look at a specific major, and display the classes needed to complete said major. In addition to this, I wanted users to be able to mark classes as complete or incomplete and see their progress towards their degree. The project failed because EMU's course catalog does not display information in a uniform way, meaning I would have to create separate functions for displaying information for each major, which defeats the point of the project.
